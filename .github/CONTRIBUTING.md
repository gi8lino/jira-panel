## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Contributions

- Follow idiomatic Go best practices.
- Ensure all changes are covered by unit tests.
- Keep functions small and maintainable.
- Follow the projectâ€™s logging and error-handling patterns.
- Avoid introducing breaking changes unless absolutely necessary.
- Use meaningful commit messages and describe the changes clearly.

### Testing

- Run tests locally before submitting a PR.
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass using:
  ```sh
  make test
  ```
- Run the end-to-end (e2e) tests to verify integration with Kubernetes:
  ```sh
  make kind
  kubectl cluster-info --context kind-cascader-test
  make e2e
  ```
  This will create a Kind cluster, switch the context to it, deploy the operator, and run the tests.
  To clean up the Kind cluster after testing, use:
  ```sh
  make delete-kind
  ```

### Linting

- Ensure your code follows Goâ€™s formatting and linting standards:
  ```sh
  make fmt vet lint
  ```
